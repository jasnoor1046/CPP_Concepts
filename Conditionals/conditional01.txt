#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int  main{
int a=500,b,c;
if(a<= 400)
b=300;
c=200;
cout<<"value of b and c are  respectively"<<b<< "and" <<c;
return 0;
}
OUTPUT: . The condition in 'if' is false, and there are no curly brackets after 
if so the code written after it will be considered in same line. Due to wrong condition, garbage value
will be stored in b and value of c will be printed as 200.
